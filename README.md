# Test 2 for Learning Rate

For this test, We took Number of Nuron: 400

Learning Rate - 1e-2

Time taken, Multiple file entries as the program crashed in between due to issue in my system, I uesd the resume feature to resume from the same mean.

# NNPong

This is our Final Project for our Big Data Class in Second Semister in Lambton College. In this project we learn about Nural Network and see how the change in the Number of Nurons and learning rate effects rate of learning. We note the time taken for reaching a Treshold value while the execution of the Program.

This base program is taken from the user [karpathy](https://gist.github.com/karpathy) and the Program - [pg-pong.py](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/a4166c7fe253700972fcbc77e4ea32c5). After that made modifications nescesary for the requirements
